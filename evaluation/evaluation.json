  {
    "question": "Analyze the internal conflict Brutus reveals in his soliloquy in Act 2, Scene 1, specifically his comparison of Caesar to a 'serpent's egg.'",
    "ideal_answer": "Brutus reveals a profound moral conflict between his personal loyalty to Caesar (who has done him no personal wrong) and his commitment to the Roman Republic. He resolves to kill Caesar not for who he is now, but for what he *might* become if crowned, comparing him to a 'serpent's egg'—a danger that must be killed in the shell before its power is hatched and becomes mischievous and uncontrollable."
  },
  {
    "question": "Compare and contrast the views of Fate versus Free Will as expressed by Cassius and Caesar in Act 1, Scene 2.",
    "ideal_answer": "Cassius embodies **Free Will** ('Men at some time are masters of their fates'), arguing that inaction is the fault for Caesar's rise. Caesar, in contrast, leans towards **Fate** ('The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...'), suggesting destiny is at play, though he often displays arrogance that suggests he believes himself above his fate."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Antony's rhetorical use of the phrase 'But Brutus is an honourable man' manipulate the plebeians and subvert Brutus's purpose?",
    "ideal_answer": "Antony uses **verbal irony** (specifically, **anaphora**) and **juxtaposition**. By repeatedly stating the phrase while providing evidence of Caesar's generosity (the will, refusing the crown), he forces the crowd to redefine 'honourable' until it becomes a sarcastic condemnation, thereby successfully turning the crowd's initial respect for Brutus into rage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Discuss the significance of Portia wounding herself in the thigh in Act 2, Scene 1.",
    "ideal_answer": "Portia's self-inflicted wound symbolizes her **strength** and her worthiness to share Brutus's secrets. It is a physical demonstration of her commitment and fortitude, proving she can endure pain and keep silent, contrasting with the weakness often ascribed to her 'sex' and emphasizing the theme of **public versus private loyalty**."
  },
  {
    "question": "Analyse the conspirators' decision to spare Mark Antony, focusing on Brutus's idealistic justification versus Cassius's practical fear.",
    "ideal_answer": "Brutus insists on sparing Antony because he wants the act to be seen as a **'sacrifice'** for justice, not 'bloody butchery,' believing Antony is harmless without Caesar (idealism). Cassius strongly argues for killing Antony because he correctly judges Antony to be a shrewd, dangerous man and a potential threat to their success (pragmatism). Brutus's idealism prevails, leading directly to their downfall."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what ways does Caesar continue to exert influence over the events in Rome even after his death?",
    "ideal_answer": "Caesar's influence continues in three key ways: **Antony's revenge** is driven by Caesar's memory and will; the **ghost of Caesar** appears to Brutus at Philippi, foreshadowing his defeat; and the political turmoil directly stems from the power vacuum Caesar's murder created, suggesting his 'spirit' is alive and seeking vengeance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Compare the nature and motivation of the **manipulation** used by Cassius against Brutus versus the manipulation used by Decius against Caesar.",
    "ideal_answer": "Cassius's manipulation is driven by **envy and republicanism** and targets Brutus's **honor and patriotism** (using forged letters). Decius's manipulation is driven by the **conspiracy's need** and targets Caesar's **pride and ambition** (by reinterpreting Calpurnia's dream and hinting at the crown). Both manipulators successfully exploit the flaw they know will motivate their target."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Shakespeare’s implied attitude towards the plebeians (the common crowd) based on their behavior in Act 3, Scenes 2 and 3?",
    "ideal_answer": "Shakespeare implies that the plebeians are **fickle, irrational, and easily swayed** by emotion over reason. They quickly switch from supporting Brutus's logical, prose-based speech to rioting based on Antony's emotional, poetic oration, demonstrating their instability and suggesting skepticism toward direct democracy."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Caesar's dying words, 'Et tu, Brutè? Then fall, Caesar!', encapsulate the tragedy of Brutus?",
    "ideal_answer": "The words highlight Brutus's **ultimate betrayal and tragic mistake**. Caesar is willing to die once he sees his most trusted, respected friend among the murderers. For Caesar, the presence of Brutus is a sign of cosmic inevitability. For Brutus, the line cements his transformation from an idealist driven by public good to a regretted murderer."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the argument between Brutus and Cassius in Act 4, Scene 3, what major flaw in Brutus's character contributes to their defeat?",
    "ideal_answer": "Brutus's flaw is his **inflexible idealism and moral self-righteousness**. He scorns Cassius for using 'dishonest means' to raise money, which forces a rift between them. Furthermore, he overrules Cassius's practical strategy by insisting they march to Philippi immediately, which turns out to be a fatal tactical error."
